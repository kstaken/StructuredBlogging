Added GPL declaration to all source files; fixed bug in handling of drafts.

--------------------------------------
version 0.4
03 March 2005

Added options page for plugin; options controlling stylesheet (include/exclude)
and amazon.com affiliates.  The logic should be largely present for other 
affiliate programs as well, at least in the edit form and preferences.  The
structure could be simplified a bit.

Now that there's an options page, it might make sense to start controlling which
pages and options are actually shown on the edit/post screens.

version 0.3
01 March 2005

Added support for yahoo movies lookups.  Updated xml inclusion to use the latest
syntax for the subnode/script blocks.
